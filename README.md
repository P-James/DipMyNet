# Fishery Search Engine

This is a mock search engine built with Laravel Livewire and Alpinejs.
It queries the database using a custom macro inspired by [this article](https://freek.dev/1182-searching-models-using-a-where-like-query-in-laravel).

With some Eloquent optimisations gleaned from [Jonathan Reinink's course](https://eloquent-course.reinink.ca/).
